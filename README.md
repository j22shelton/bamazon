Technology Used:

This app is an Amazon-like storefront created with MySQL, Node.js, and javascript.


How it works:

The app takes in orders from customers who view the inventory, then choose the item, and also the quantity of the product they wish to purchase. 

Afterwards, the app depletes inventory by the amount of the customer's purchase.

The app also knows if there is insufficient inventory and prevents the transaction from occuring in this case.


Note: In order for the app to work you must run "npm install" in the terminal.
